Any chance some kind soul would get us some pizza since we don't have any cash anymore?","3":"It's cold, I'n hungry, and to be completely honest I'm broke. My mum said we're having leftovers for dinner. A random pizza arriving would be nice.\n\nEdit: We had leftovers.","4":"hey guys:\n I love this sub. I think it's great. (Except the sob stories. I miss when this place was fun!) Anywho, I've given a pizza out before so thought I would try my luck at getting one. My friend, who lives an hour away and our schedules do not let us see each other too much, decided to come down and visit me for the night!

My email is usfstuff@yahoo.com, since I'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.\n\n\nMy two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.\n\n\nI would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub\/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub\/pzone haha. Using a few coupons, I can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!\n\n\nThe pic for our huge TECO deposit :\/\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/B0uoo","7":"(Request) I have given a few things on reddit, a copy of skyrim + 1 year of xbocks live, and soon to be a binder full of magic cards, when i can mail it.

We were all sort of counting on the deposit from our last apartment to help us out, but they claimed there was damages, so we did not receive anything. So, we're sort of struggling. Is anyone able to help us out for dinner tonight? We'd really appreciate it!\n","10":"I've been unemployed but working odd jobs. I worked a job yesterday which I thought paid up front - it did not. Now I'm sitting at home dreaming of pizza (literally, I took a nap and dreamt there was pizza in my fridge, but woke up to nothing but leftover pasta). Will pay forward when I get a chance!","11":"Been a lurker for some time, figured I'd give it a shot. Nothing special about me. Just moved to San Francisco and don't know many people, so I figured I'd just stay in tonight and hope for some cheesy goodness. :)","12":"I am a stay at home mom of two kids i live with my husband his parents and my kids! The only reason that I am unemployed is because my husband was hit by a drunk driver a little over a year ago and was seriously injured and was almost killed! so i quit work to help him through recovery and take care of the kids while living with my in-laws off of their ssi checks (which are tiny)! Its the end of the month and we're broke! We are not starving but we aren't eating all that well either! Please be my pizza hero!","13":"Hey recently moved downtown, but still working in sandy springs so I am spending all of my money on gas.  I don't get paid until wednesday and would love some pizza.  I will definitely pass on the love once I get my check!","14":"I have never requested a pizza before but I've given a few out, so I'm a firm believer that this works. However, I'm spending Christmas with the in-laws, who are sceptical about the generosity of Redditors. Please prove them wrong with a pizza! Will send a thank-you of the whole fam, including cat!

It would be great to have some pizza tonight, feeling under the weather. I don't get paid until the weekend, and this would make our day. ","19":"Been looking for work for 2 weeks since moving back to my hometown.. Haven't had a paycheque for 2 months. Finally get a lead, two phone interviews, and an interview scheduled for today. I get in there, and the HR manager explains that they \"Tried to reach me yesterday\" to tell me not to come in. Unfortunately they did not email nor did I have a message on my phone from them, so I just wasted the entire last 24 hours scrambling around and spent the rest of my money getting prepped for an interview I showed up for and didn't even fucking get.\n\nPizza may in fact be the only thing that satisfies my vindictive rage at this point. Moreso I'm just really, really hungry and haven't been able to eat well lately. The friends I'm staying with give me a bite here and there, but they're very low income with 3 kids and I try to avoid it at all costs. Would seriously appreciate it, and pay it forward!","20":"I can't draw.. at all but I'd really love a pizza for me and my roommate tonight and I thought I'd try and cheer him up with some since he is pretty down today. I can try and draw you something in MS paint? I don't have kittens or cute cat pictures I can show so sorry to dissapoint :(","21":"We're a group of 4 college students, who don't have enough money collectively to buy ourselves a pizza, so we thought we may leave it to the RAOP gods (or goddesses) to decide whether or not we're meant to have this pizza. We live in Central California, and would very much appreciate a delicious pizza! \n","22":"I hope I'm doing this right. I waited before posting, because I thought I would have money for food tonight. I tried selling some textbooks on Craigslist, but the person who wanted to buy them never showed up. The money I was going to get from my textbooks was going to be used for food for the week. I am completely out of food and very hungry.

Thank you so much! http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza\/comments\/1g3me0\/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts\/\n\nIt's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.

If you're willing to wait a week or two, I can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. In that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black.

I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.\n\nA little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.\n\nThe job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.\n \nI did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.\n\nWhile working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).\n\nWhile I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.\n\nThere I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,\n\nA month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.\n\nSee family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!\n\nJuly 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.\n\nOh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!\n\nCan reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? \n\nI can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.\n\n  ","56":"I don't like asking for hand outs, honestly, but some Pizza for my boyfriend and I would be fantastic and beyond appreciated!","57":"I will send an offer on friday to return the favor and keep it going.","58":"Student living in waterloo, ontario.

He lost 30% of his body weight and as a result his temperature also dropped a whopping 8 degrees F below normal.\n\n\nWe spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, Critical Care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  I also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, I basically just get work whenever I tell my boss I'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and Sunday.  My boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and I've missed school so I'm also way behind.\n\n\n\nHe needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  He's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  His mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  This is taking every bit of our energy.\n\n\n\nIf he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of Critical Care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  The estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  Keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since Bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you've made it this far, I'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Black Jack (those are the closest places to us).  If you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the Tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too\/instead.  Anything to keep us from Ramen would be so appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.

Don't know what happened to my post. Confused and new. We are ready for a random act of pizza to fall upon us. We are cheesy, saucy pizza livers who can't buy any due to stupid injury at work. Pizza us lol.","166":"I haven't eaten all day (except for muh cereal, but it was the nock of publix brand chereioes. Oh I also ate publix icecream, but someone left it was a milkshake. Not to mention the fact that I dropped the container spilling i....)\n\nwow I just realized how many food related accidents I've had today. Anyways I dropped the container and spilt melted icecream all over the kitchen floor. But at that point I didn't care because my bagel was done. It burned in the toaster. Hurt but not knocked down I scraped the black off the bagel and put some delicious salmon cream cheese on it (if you don't have salmon cream cheese get some it sounds extremely gross, but is actually pretty decent). Finally my little brother (14) tried to snatch my bagel out of my hands. He knocked it into the air luckily I bobbled it enough to regain control of my delicious snack. Unfortunately, I also bobbled cream cheese all over my arms and face. but fear not! I took revenge by sneaking up on him from behind and slapping a large amount of cream cheese on his face (the good kind).\n\nyeah. That was my day today (not to mention all the college apps I did). This is why I deserve a mushroom pizza. Cheers.","167":"So, I [wrote](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/unitedkingdom\/comments\/lsqto\/i_would_like_to_take_a_moment_to_rant_about\/) a week or so ago about the problems I was having getting the student finance company to get my loan to me, and it still hasn't been resolved and I've reached the end of my overdraft (they'll only give me a \u00a3200 overdraft until my loan comes through). I tried to go to my university to get some emergency funds and the lady I spoke to said I could only get a \u00a350 bridging loan which seeing as I'd have to pay back in 4 weeks she didn't want to give me. And after arguing with her for quite a while about how I needed the money to buy food she said that it didn't matter because the lady who could've given me the money left at 2pm (I went in at 1:30pm, she was just arguing with me for that long). \n\nI then went into my bank to try and get my overdraft extended and they told me I needed to do it over the phone, went home and called them up and apparently I needed to go back to my branch and do it. And it would be shut by the time I went in again today.... \n\nSo could anyone possibly send me a pizza or like... any other food? I haven't eaten all day :( ","168":"I have been on food stamps for about the past 10 months because my job only pays a small living stipend, but my food stamps were cancelled last month. They were cancelled when my phone number changed and I didn't convey this information to the correct person at the welfare office apparently. Anyway, I have been working to get them back but it takes forever and needless to say I have been kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel, food-wise lately. \n\nI would really appreciate a pizza and will definitely pay it forward as soon as I get everything sorted out. Fingers crossed I will be getting a job with a full salary soon anyway!","169":"I am retired army and a disabled veteran and I also have a cleaning business. Right now contracts are very low and so my income has dropped. The cost of the business has started eating into my personal funds and until contracts increase I'm living day to day. I have 1 bag of beans left on the shelf and the food pantry is closed for the weekend as a matter of fact it's closed Monday also. I work hard and that won't stop because I enjoy what I do, I'm just stuck and asking for a little help to keep my family fed and I hope to be able to help someone else in the future :)\n","170":"Let me start by saying that this site is incredible.  First of all, it's encouraging to see so many wonderful people out there helping each other.  That's just magical.  The other side of that is while I'm not glad to know there are others going through what I'm going through, I am glad to know that I'm not alone.  I think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  You look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  Some people make life look so easy.  I haven't know easy in a long time.  There's a Sheryl Crow song that goes, \"No one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard.\"  I hear that in my head a lot.  I'm not looking for easy, I just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.  \n\nI will say this though.  Today has been an amazing day.  I came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  I can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  This is a feeling that everyone should know.  \n\nMy husband died a little over a year ago.  I have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  In January I went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that I could have a steady future.  I can not tell you how intimidating it is being back in school all these years later and being a mom on top of that.  It's going well though, and I'm excited for the future.  \n\nWe are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  My daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and I'm having a small party for her at our home.  It has a modest budget, and I've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  What I'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  It's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that I'm not in a position to really splurge on.  \nI'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.\n\nThank you.\n","171":"Her name is Chinadoll and she apparently had an enormous hairball stuck in her intestines.  We had taken her to the emergency vet clinic and they did a bunch of tests on her and all of them were really expensive, and then they told us that she would need surgery (which was $2000).  She is home and getting back to being her usual rambunctious self, but of course she should be lying down and recuperating.  We're all dead tired due to sleepless nights of waiting around at the clinic and worrying about her, of course, and could really go for some pizza.\n\nAs for the story behind Chinadoll, she is a huge, fluffy, grey cat.  She is sometimes very sweet and loving but usually cruel, stubborn, and dominating.  She is always far smarter than us, very energetic, and very beautiful.  She has been described as a \"probability cloud of evil\".  As a kitten, she was rescued from being hanged by some young assholes.  My SO and I love our four cats as our children, and the other two people in our house see them as family, too.\n\nIf you want to treat us to pizza, there are four people here and we like Cottage Inn.  Other pizza places would be fine, though.  An e-gift card would be the best for this, I think.\n\nHere are some photos of Chinadoll: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/AMKC6\n\nThank you for reading, kind Redditors!\n\n","172":"Car won't start and I need my car for work to feed my kids.

Hopefully for only another week or two. Basically my story is I was laid off a month and a half ago. I had a little bit of cash and my unemployment so everything was looking not great but at least ok. Well an employer from last fall is contesting the fact that they should have to contribute to my unemployment. I had the phone hearing, I know I am in the right, I got a w2 from them with taxes taken out. But until the final call is made, my unemployment checks are being withheld.

Sometime on Sunday, my Xbox Live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of Xbox Live points were charged to my debit card. I called Xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as I realized. THEY said it would take 25 days, and I should contact my bank if I want a speedier return of my precious monies. They also said my Xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.\n\nToday after work, I did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. The banker said, or so I thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. Mission accomplished, I head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.   \n\nI had my food items rounded up and checked out, when BAM! My card was declined. Okay... maybe they went ahead and turned it off for purchases. No worries, my bank is across the street, and while they may be closed, they have an ATM.  \n\nMaybe you see where this is going...  \n\nOM NOM NOM went the ATM, gobbling my debit card and spitting out a mere slip of paper in its stead- in essence it said \"this is **our** card now, criminal.\"  \n\nSo that's it.

Applying for visas, passports, getting medical clearances, seeing every doctor in town, selling my car, buying a new wardrobe, packing or selling everything I own... you get the idea. My GF and I have been waking up, scrambling all day, and going back to bed. We are exhausted and broke.\n\n-I am leaving to Taiwan in 4 days, and I still have so much to do that it's quite upsetting.\n\n-From what I understand, the pizza situation in Taiwan is quite depressing :(\n\nSo, I ask for some help for my GF and I, one last chance to eat some pizza before we move on into the unknown (and one less thing to have to figure out tonight as we continue packing).\n\nI had always read about this sub-reddit, but never participated. I always figured that if I did, I would be giving away a pizza. But, at the moment, it seems life put me in the position of the requester.\n\nPizza or not, I think this is a really cool subreddit, and I am super excited to be moving abroad, despite all the stress involved with preparing.\n\nThanks for listening, and I can't wait until I am in a position to be the pizza giver.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I am in the Atlanta, GA area. I just re-read the info site and noticed I missed this bit.\n","441":"~~Reddit has given me a lot lately, and I am very thankful.

So now I'm here asking if someone can help me out with a pizza so I can eat today. I don't get paid until Wednesday so all my money is on bills and gas. Help a brother out?????

Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading. \n\nHe took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.\n\nToday I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives. \n\nAlso being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge\/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along. \n\nTL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate.

Most of the new jobs in my hometown of Tullahoma, TN, are far beyond my reach of experience (i.e., medical jobs like registered nurses, etc.).

Most of the time we have to rely on local churches to help pay our bills and put gas in our car. While a pizza would definitely raise my spirits it would do the same for my parents.

It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.\n\nI also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.\n\nAnd then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.\n\n(I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) \n\nMy boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.\n\nSo, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.\n\nSorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(\n\nTL;DR: Broken foot causes me to lose shitty job that barely paid my expenses anyway. Would love pizza. Would also love to give pizza when I can afford it.","715":"Life is a hectic mess right now and eating on the cheap has had its merits, but if I eat one more egg or package of ramen I may cry.

The pay increase would help oh so very much, so I'm crossing my fingers! Hopefully if the job comes through, I can pay it forward.\n\nThanks! &lt;3","716":"i'm really hungry and all my money is going towards my ultrasound tomorrow, pretty please with sugar on top buy me a pizza? i'll send you the ultrasound picture when i found out the gender tomorrow! celebration time!\ni'll also loveee you forever. thank youuu.","717":"My girlfriend and I wouldn't mind a nice pizza - normally I'd have plenty to eat but the bank happens to be closed today so no cash for me :( any takers?

Insurance couldn't cover it all. Had to empty my bank account to pay for a lawyer, and on top of that I got laid off from my job a few months ago.

All of my bills and rent are\/were late, I can barely afford enough food, and, to top it off, I can't even go snowboarding....which is truly the only thing that keeps me sane in the winter. All of my friends are snowboarders and most of them are out riding tonight. I'm not saying a pizza would cure the shit that's going through my head, but I could definitely use one to help restore some optimism in my life.\nEDIT: I know I'm not in the worst of shape with where I'm at, but I do battle with some very strong depression from time to time and right now is one of those times.

Somewhere along that path girl starts working for scumbag corporation. When it comes time for maternity leave as the lil' redditor is close to being born, scumbag corporation says 'don't worry, all of your benefits will continue, you'll get paid leave, have fun with teh baby cuddles.' \n\nWell, we really wish it had worked out like that :( I took a full 12 week leave, as available to me thanks to FMLA. 7 Weeks were paid thanks to short term disability, but my company made me wait 3 weeks to get that money, which sucked. My insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while I was on leave, even though I was assured they'd continue. When I got back to work two weeks ago I fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time I was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. That adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! They are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. They are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over. \n\nLuckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and I are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta. We'd kill for something with flavor at this point, and a pizza sounds like heaven. As soon as we get caught up financially, which according to my strict budget won't be until late November, I plan on doing the same for another redditor in need! \n\ntl,dr; My company is basically making me pay for my maternity leave after the fact, to the sum of $2400. We can't afford groceries because of this right now and would just love one night where we can have the luxury of a pizza. Thanks!","783":"I'm not due to go back to my job until next week.

My husband can't work right now and I'm trying so desperately to find work on the side to feed us and pay for his immigration.

He is Canadian and anyone out there who fell in love with someone in another country understands that it's an expensive process. We're both depressed. Me because I can't do more.

I'm currently jobless waiting to hear back from a temp service. My husband works his ass off for free pretty much, because he cannot find a job not even through the three temp services in our area. When he first started this job he was making amazing money. But things slowed down extremely. He went from bringing home $100-$200 a night to $15 or less a day. He also has to pay for gas which is $15 a day. So as you can see he's not making money at all right now.\n    The only reason why he is staying with this job, is because the owner is making him co-owner next year and also letting him stock vending machines so he'll be making two salaries. So my husband is trying to keep whats best for our future in mind. \n  However I'm in starvation mode, I've lost 4 pounds in one week due to not eating. I've been snacking around the pieces of moldy bread, hoping for my husband to have a good day and hoping I hear back from the temp service that is suppose to be contacting me back.. I just called my husband and he's only at $60 (he makes 25% of that, which will be used for gas ) and he's going to be heading back to the shop in 20 minutes. So it's another bad day.

Even something as simple as plain cheese would be awesome. I'm a cheap date. \n\nThis is my first time posting here, so I'm not entirely sure how this works. I'll keep tabs on my post over the course of the next hour or two in the hope it's seen by anyone willing to help. In return I can either pay it forward when I can, or order a pizza for you down the road once I'm back on my feet. Thanks in advance  :)\n\n*Edit - I know, I know....my choices aren't exactly ideal, but alas those are the three closest options. I'm not exactly in a position to be picky, so even Domino's sounds great right now. But I don't have a preference between the three. Whatever is the cheapest still works for me. \n\n*Edit 2 - If you were planning on ordering a pie or two tonight and you're willing to share, I'd be happy to join you as long as it's a public setting. I'm still unsure how this all works....am I supposed to provide a phone number and an address to someone via PM? \n\n*Edit 3 - Well, this isn't getting any attention and my stomach is gurgling all the same, so I'm just going to scrounge for the evening. Short of a miracle in the job department I'm still going to be nearly broke tomorrow and a little while beyond, so if anyone would like to help me out another day, that would still be great. \n","843":"Just down on my luck.

First chick to furnish both wins a date with me and a pillow covered in drool.\"\n\nA friend responded with this link.\nNothing special about my story, but here goes.\nA bit over a year ago, I bombed out of college. Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie\/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.\n\nWhat can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing. I live in the St. Johns neighbourhood of North Portland. Hope I got everything I need here, lemme know any questions or otherwise.

The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.\n\nHe's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind.

This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?\n\nI don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. I can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how I wanna start.","1186":"Hey there Reddit. Things haven't been going right for the next few days. My [roommate and best friend](http:\/\/imgur.com\/ALJUP) started having suicidal thoughts a few days ago, and ended up checking herself into the ER for observation. I've just paid off rent, two weeks late, and have no money until Thursday. And my younger sister came over today because she keeps getting sick at her apartment, which means there's two mouths to feed and not much food to go around.\n\nI'm lonely, sad, and worn down and I'm hoping that some pizza and silly tv shows might turn that around. Thing is, there's no pizza currently. If anyone is willing to donate some I would be insanely grateful. \n\nThanks in advance.","1187":"My first time posting here so I thought I'd try it out. I've been broke from putting money into my gas tank for the 40 minute drive to school.

I'm a single Dad of three of the greatest junior geeks you could ask for.

But if you can spare, it would bring some major smiles to my home. Thanks for reading this!\n\nEdit: Blerg...that should have said needier above, not nerdier.

I'm the creator\/mod of a top 50 most active subreddit (according to [subredditfinder](http:\/\/subredditfinder.com\/)). It's also in the top 100 in most subscribed, fastest rising, and other categories. The reason why I even mention this is so you know I'm a real redditor and not some random outsider trying to exploit your generosity. I'm not using my real account name for reasons I will thoroughly explain if you IM me. Even if you don't plan on helping me.\n\nFinally, what I **can** explain here in the open is this: I've lost 15lbs in ~1 week due to not eating. I've lost my appetite because of a major life crisis, but now as I'm trying to get back into the swing of things I need to be strong but severe loss of financial stability (i think the technical term is being broke as fuck) means that I'm starting to break down physically, and that will jeopardize my ability to get back on track with my life.\n\nI would actually prefer groceries (maybe milk, bread, or eggs), but I know thre is no Random_Acts_of_Balanced_Nutrition out there. I don't even know if I can get food stamps by now, and even if I can it might be too late. Either way, I would appreciate pizza just as much.\n\nAnyways, I realize that I am rambling, but I'd be more than glad to explain my full situation to anyone that cares. I just don't want to make this post searchable by a particular person for reasons I will explain.\n\nIf this sounds shady, I completely understand. But again, I will be more than glad to give full details in PM; info which can easily be verified.\n\nJust don't contact me with a sockpuppet account. I don't want some troll to go and fuck me over with the sensitive info I give them. We can talk 1-on-1 with our legit accounts.","1191":"I would really appreciate a free pizza, I don't know if it works this specifically, but Pizza hut is the closest to my house.

Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game\/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.\n\n*Note: Contains disturbing and\/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*\n\n\nThe project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http:\/\/0011011001111000.bandcamp.com\/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/0011011001111000) and [here](http:\/\/0011011001111000.tumblr.com\/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.\n\n**So here's the thing:**\nI'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.

I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.\n\nBut now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.\n\nI rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.\n\nIt's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.\n\nI must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to \"pay-it-back\" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).\n\n\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\n*","1270":"Wages were supposed to be in my bank account this morning, they weren't.

Today I get to eat...you guessed it...more rice! Yay! \n\nI try to stay upbeat about what's been going on, but sometimes it's just hard to keep smiling.

She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). \n\n**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**\n\nThe problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating.

I have been promised 2 well-paying jobs and one minimum wage + .40 to fill in the gaps of unemployment of a second job, if that makes sense, but I'm waiting until they call me in for that expendable job, a background check for one, and a test request for the other. I will be able to pay forward this one and the previous random act of pizza when I can get my life straight. I will pay the previous one forward whether I get food from this or not. Didn't want to sound like I'm taking that promise to pay it forward hostage. Anyway, it would benefit me, my roommate, his brother, and his mom greatly if we could get some pizza.\n\nEdit: Not caring what trolls like francewinwars say, especially if all they do is convince people to NOT help the less-fortunate.

I came straight from a netball game to here, so haven't eaten a thing since lunch.\n\nTo explain the title, I am absolutely and completely broke in terms of both spirit and cash. The year started off with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me and having to move out, which sunk me into a state of depression.\n\nI was working full time, but had plans in place to go back to uni and leave my job. My annual leave payout was going to cover my credit card debts, and I was to rely on welfare + a part time job to cover rent, bills, petrol, etc. The annual leave payout was a lot less than I anticipated, as I was taxed a lot, meaning I could only pay off one credit card, and the rest paid my rent in advance for a couple of weeks to make sure there were no issues there. Centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me I may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. I've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work. I made $100 last week for fixing a family members computer, and I put in about 15 hours of work to earn that money, but haven't seen any more since. \n\nMy car rego is now overdue, I have two months of unpaid phone bills that need to be paid, when I run out of petrol (I have about half a tank at the moment) I have no idea how I'm going to get to and from uni, and I have absolutely no idea where the money for my car payment and insurance is going to come from on Friday. Not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which I'm now starting to get payment reminders for.\n\nThe reason I'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, I'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. I've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what I'm going to do when I need to start making rent payments again. Not to mention being out dealing with centerlink and desperately looking for work.\n\nPlease help a fellow redditor in need out and sort me out with a pizza to help me get through the night. When a source of income comes in, I am more than happy to return the favour. When I do have money, I try to regularly made it a habit to help people out. I'm also happy to fulfil requests, but bear in mind that I'm at uni.\n\nThanks in advance =)\n","1407":"(Tennessee USA) It is a day to celebrate after all! We just can't afford to dine.

I am from Texas, and for the past few months I've been preparing to start college in Florida. The original plan was I would drive here to Florida, take a test, then return home and do my coursework online for the first 90 days, which would give me time to pull the funds together for the move to Florida. Unfortunately, they failed to inform me that the online option only applies to students who do exceptionally well on that test, which I did not. Just for the first trip, I had to sell something that was very important to me. Then I took the test and they told me I either had to give up my dream of becoming a student at their university, or move to Florida immediately.

When hurricane Sandy came rolling through, given that we had missed at least a week and a half of school, most professors took this into consideration and removed certain assignments that were due considering time constraints.

In fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons I'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic I hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. He even has the parts that I paid for sitting on his property. I simply don't have the know how to do so, or I'd do it myself.\n\nAs far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect.

My husband has 3 children ages 15, 11, and 8. I have my 14 year old son.  We are raising the 4 of them without any help (physical, mental or financial) from the other parents.  We have had to close down our Small Business this year due to the economy and for the first time have had to go on public assistance.  We are struggling to find gainful employment for my husband, but so far have had no luck.  I would be willing to go back to work immediately, however I will be having lung surgery in the near future to find out if I have cancer.  It seems like with the summer here we should be having some kind of fun with our kiddos, but we are not able to afford to take them anywhere so we have made \"movie\" night and \"game\" night at home......a pizza would make it a wonderful night....a much needed wonderful night.

(Specifically The Soulard Area)\n\nSo here is my story, Hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..\n\nFor the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery.\nAt one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. Talked to my family and got help. I was addicted to Amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. I spend 42 days in rehab.. Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors)\nThings were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant.\nWell. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.\n\nShe had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.\n\nSo here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. I have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house.\nBUT i am STILL SOBER! Which i am proud of, Months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong.\nSo i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to Make my evening tonight. I would LOVE to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.\n\nI can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: Graduation certificates, An empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of..\nThanks in advance.\n\nTLDR; Living Life Like a boss, then old warrant came up, Lost everything because of bad decisions in the past.. pizza will help morale.","1729":"I found this community through [another post](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/reddit.com\/comments\/iphuy\/during_an_illness_a_friend_recommended_reddit_to\/) and thought it sounded pretty ludicrous, so I figured I would check it out.

Now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( But tomorrow i tell myself.

I spent all last week desperately searching for a place to live..  Since I'm disabled, and still waiting for my benefits to start, I knew I could never afford a place for myself.. So I did what most people in my situation would do.. I had faith that between my family and all my friends..  SomeONE.. (I thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  After waiting a few days, I realized that no one was going to come to my aid.. So I decided to start asking those who I KNEW would do anything for me.. Or so I thought.. Immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought.. Since they were the only ones in my family that had room for me, I had to move on to my good friends.. My best friend lives 4 hours away so that just wasn't an option.. My other best friend AND neighbor would definitely take me in.. I just knew she would!!  She has an empty guest bedroom and everything.. So I asked if she could help me out and let me stay in the guest room for no longer than a month.. Without even pretending to think about it.. She said \"I don't have any room for you\".. That was it.. I had exhausted all my options.. One day before my eviction I started to plan the best way to be homeless.. I decided to live in my van.... Scary doesn't come close to how I felt, but my fear was deep.... Ring Ring! It's Curtis.. A friend I met thru my best friend.. I knew him and considered him a friend but we didn't know each other very well.. Without hesitation he said that he heard about my situation and wanted to offer me a place on his couch..  I burst into tears.. I was relieved.. But mostly, I was so touched to receive such extreme generosity from someone who is also struggling just as hard as I am!  So here we are at his 1 bedroom apartment.. Trying to figure out how we are going to afford something to eat TONIGHT.. Let alone tomorrow.. But It's 6:52pm and neither of us have eaten today.. I want Curtis to have this pizza cause he deserves it!

I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)\n\nAbout 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.\n\nAfter about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. \n\nIt's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. \n\nBy the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).\n\nI met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. \n\nFor his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.\n\nSo, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. \n\nI hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. \n\nFast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me.

Two years ago the love of my life dumped me because for 6 months before that I had become a drinking machine. It wasn't just when I was depressed. I would drink when I was happy, sad, hungry, tired, stressed. I would even go to work and school drunk. It became a major problem when I got alcohol poisoning. To keep her from leaving I agreed to quit drinking completely and start going to meetings. Suprisingly, it worked and I was on the fast track to living a much better (happier) booze free lifestyle. In the past month my girlfriend and I have argued constantly. Thursday night she confessed she had been cheating on me for about three months with my bestfriend, who had also helped me stop drinking. My gf left after that, she came home three hours later reaking of vodka and she had vomit in her hair, in her inebriation she told me how her and my bestfriend had been sneaking around partying together and \"one thing just lead to another\" and they had fallen inlove. This had come to me as a shock because not even 2 months ago she had agreed to help me take care of my brother when I got custody of him. Yesterday she left me she said she'd be back for her things. I tried to go about my day the way I would any other day, I went to my AA meeting got my 24 months sober token. I went to work and got through the day as best I could crying in the bathroom on my lunch break. After work I went to the bank to withdrawl money to pay my bills, only to find out she took all my money out of my bank account 20 minutes after my check was direct deposited. I didn't know what else to do. I wont be able to pay my bills or buy food. I don't know how I am going to feed the kids, or if we'll even have a place to live. My bills are adding up quickly and we have no food. My landlord is very strict and will not bend on my rent because we've only lived here for 90 day. I am but sure what to do. School starts next week and I can't get supplies or outfits. I used my last bit of gas to go to a food pantry only to find out that I make too much money for assistance and I can't get a payday loan because I got one two weeks ago to help fix my now exs car.

One love!","2085":"I wish I was making this story up, but unfortunately this has been real life for the last couple of weeks.  My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? So, last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message, no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party, come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are \"resealing\" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.  If someone would send a pizza to our new place it would make me (and I'm sure my brother...he loves pizza) the happiest mover that has ever walked the planet!","2086":"My kids love pizza but unfortunately I haven't been able to afford it lately :-( if anyone would be willing to get us pizza we would be so happy!

My next decent paycheck isn't until January 10th (I do have a very small one coming in on Friday, but because one of my two jobs isn't active during the winter break, said check will be very small and immediately eaten by groceries).

We were required to use our own vehicles because the company only had so many (that were breaking down anyway).  The transmission went in my husbands car and our boss told him that he refuses to pay for the gas to run the stuff in a van instead of his car that he can't afford to get fixed and fired him.  We were in a tight spot in the first place because we're constantly spending our money on fixing the cars (that we still owe $10k on) + necessities. We have an infant, 9yr old, 11yr old and a pet dog. Ever since he lost his job we've been eating nothing but cheap things (hamburger helper, ramen, hot dogs) for at least a month.  We were accepted for food stamps but with my income they only give us $150 per month which lasts us a week with the amount of food my boys consume. My husband has had interview after interview with no luck whatsoever. I think they'd be really happy to come home from the pool tonight and have a great feast of pizza. \n\nTldr; We're broke and sick of the same dinner table scenery and would really like a couple pizzas tonight.\n\nWe were taken care of!

I picked him up to see if he would recognize me, but he wasn't his playful self. I rushed him to the vets, where he was kept overnight.

Car broke down at the beginning of the month, which means I've been busing until payday on Friday. My Grammy passed away suddenly from complications from lung cancer on January 11th. Being alone in WA meant a very complicated and extended grieving process as I couldn't get down to Oregon until the day before the funeral. Came back up and found that on top of my car being broken down, my tire went flat as it sat there completely still and parked meaning I'll have to get it fixed and replace a tire now. Then yesterday I was on Skype with my boyfriend who is an Airman and already far away in Omaha and he got orders. They're for Japan. And he leaves in April. We had plans for his leave in June.

Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.\n\n* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems\n\n* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).\n\n* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. \n\n* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.\n\n* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.\n\n* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship. \n\nAside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger. \n","2437":"I'm a 22 year old guy living in the outskirts of Seattle.

I am deeply touched reading all of these posts.  Both from those in need, and those looking to help.  It is amazing to see people helping each other this way.  There was a point when getting a pizza meant nothing.  It was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  Those days are long gone.  In the last year I've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  I do get unemployment, but I'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  It's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  TV service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.

I have been looking for work for over 2 years now.  I just recently had to move back home, and I am incredibly lucky to have a mother who would even allow such a thing.  She still has two pre-teen children at home, and works incredibly hard.  Hopefully I can be a positive influence to everyone now that I am living with my fam.  I know my little bro is going to love the three drumsets I brought home (he just started learning).  He seems genuinely interested in music, and I know that's one thing I can really help him with.  Even though I didn't work over the past few years, I have had some great experiences that really started to give me direction.  I am lucky enough to be able to live at home now, and go back to school.  My goal is to get back into a University in a years time, study in intnat'l business and economics and live in Europe for a while (I love to be the foreigner and there is so much to see!).  I kinda did everything backwards, but I am actually excited about working towards my goals.  I would love to celebrate this new beginning with some pizza, but the few bucks I have to spend for myself are going towards bills and I want to take my little bro to go see the Hobbit tomorrow when he gets off of school.

The mother is a year younger and takes care of her while he is at our apartment for university - but he heard today that his baby is sick and in the hospital.  He can't miss class, so he's stuck hours away from his baby in our apartment worried sick.\n\nIn addition, while riding on a bus to class, he took his keys out (it was about to storm) and put them in his hands to get into his car immediately after exiting the bus.  He left the bus, but apparently forgot his keys, and had to wait outside as it stormed for the bus to loop around (takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 45), then found out that the keys somehow made their way onto ANOTHER BUS, so he had to go back to campus, chase down the bus they were on, and finally get home.  All during a storm.\n\nI'm broke for a few days until I get some money, and I'll definitely pay it forward down the line when I have some money to spend, but if someone could spare a few dollars and help get my roommate's week back on track, I'd love you forever.\n\nEDIT: We live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana","2505":"hungry pre-vet student in chicago studying for midterms would love a small cheese pizza from papa john's.  it would make her and Chessums very happy.  http:\/\/a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-snc7\/s720x720\/377322_153562588077598_100002715727381_169060_1155192583_n.jpg ","2506":"","2507":"Title kinda says it all.

Both the pizza end of things and other areas.  I had no idea about reddit.  This Random Acts of Pizza is truly amazing to follow.

That's where I am anyway :)\n\nI've been married for almost 10 years.  My wife and I have two beautiful children, a daughter 5, and a son 6.  When I met my wife, I was working crazy hours and didn't always have time for everything we wanted, but Friday night was always our date night.  It started purely by accident when she invited me over for pizza and a movie one night, and we've kept the tradition alive all these years.  We used to go out to the movies, and when that got too expensive, we enjoyed a movie at home.  When the kids got older, date night was expanded to family night.  Pizza and a movie for everyone.  We've gone through a lot of things in the last few years.  It's often felt like one step forward and two steps back.  We're still moving though.  Still fighting.  There came a point where pizza became a luxury, and it's something we've accepted and moved on.  I laugh when people talk about discretionary income.  We've learned to shave a lot of corners and given up a lot of things just to pay the bills.  \n\nAnyway, I guess my request is this.  I would love to, just for one night, be able to surprise the family with our pizza tradition.  They deserve it, and I wish I could give it to them.\n\nI'm sure above me and below me are probably posts of people that need it more than we do, and I say give it to them.  If someone knows what it's like to be in this place and wants to help out, it would be much appreciated.\n\nI look forward to the day I can come on here and make someone's day.  No promises of when I'll be able to do that, but I can promise it will happen, and I will be spreading the word about this and hope that more people will offer help to those who need it.\n\nThanks for listening, and sorry for the long post.

I'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (\u00a39 to last until the end of August).\n\nI went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in Peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).\n\nFor years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.\n\nThis, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates \u00a3100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a \u00a3970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only \u00a330 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and \u00a340 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her \u00a3500).\n\nI've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.\n\nI spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.\n\nSorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...\n\nBut yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha. Thanks for listening &lt;3","2661":"First time playing Tijuana, Mexico earlier this week and I was a little sketched out.

Now I'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. No matter what time he gets home, I still wont be able to eat. So all I'm asking for is a small pizza for one so I can eat tonight.\n\nTL;DR: Grandpa and my mom are in the hospital.

It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen\/bathroom\/toilet\/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep. \nThat happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play\/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed.

This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.\n\nI applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.\n\nAnyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.\n\nWe are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing\/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet\/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.\n\nI'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me.

THIS after he was working 55-60 hours a week before the accident (he was a passenger).  We went through our savings during his time out and have overdrawn our Netspend account over $90.

I would just really like for my children to have a filling dinner.  We have no bread, no milk, no meat.  Just one cheese and one pepperoni pizza would mean more to my family than I can express.

We'll refer to her as an 80's metal musician. Let's say, Dave Mustaine. Dave and I started talking over a social media site, but for vagueness, we'll say headnovel. We met in real life shortly after, and became the best of friends very fast. About 3 months into hanging out, my ex-girlfriend called me while we were hanging out at my cabin, and I got upset because the ex was saying terrible things. To rectify this, Dave thought she should kiss me, and she did. Things went from best friends to Relationship pretty fast. But Dave had a boyfriend she never saw. Literally, NEVER. He asked her out, and from then on, it was a textual relationship. Eventually, I told her she needed to decide between the two of us, but she said she didn't want to hurt him. So I cut it off. Fast forward a few months ago, she came back into my life with a different boyfriend, one she actually saw. I wanted to hang out with her again because she saw eye to eye with me on more things than last time, which was a lot. She frequents reddit and other such sites, we laugh at memes and dumb things, hate everyone that is ignorant, we appreciate good music, and are very emotional. This time, reddit, she took my virginity while she was emotionally with her new boyfriend. I didn't regret it at first. I do now. Dave was made to choose between us once more, and she chose her boyfriend yet again. But for some dumb reason, I still talked to her up until about 24 hours ago. I wanted to fix it, to wait for this girl that I thought was the girl of my dreams. I still want to fix it. But she just hurts me. All day, I've tried to act normal, like hang out with friends and such, and I just feel removed from it. I just want some comfort food and to listen to punk music and be the stereotypical heartbroken teenage boy.\nTL;DR girl of my dreams breaks my heart and virginity and I would like some comfort food right now.\n\nI'll pay it forward however you ask, if I can.\n\nLocation:\nMessage for details.\nThanks.\n","2992":"Hey guys.

But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.\n\nI have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325\/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.\n\nI've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.\n\nAlso, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.\n\nSo here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.\n\nNOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)\n\nEDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft.

","3012":"Blasting music and hungry :(","3013":"New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.\n\n I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.\n\nI've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.\n\nMy family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?\n\nSince I got fired I don't get unemployment, and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when I got their, 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.\n\nSo that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day. I just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches Dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term.

Please excuse the new account, I saw this on the news, what an amazing idea!\n\nI am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. Her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails.

My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. Somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. When he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account.

We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. \n\nI'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)\n\nAdd that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for\/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P\nWe literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling. \n\nWhat would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days. \n\nI might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation.

She arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. Four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. My dad never cooks and this is fine because I'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. But I've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when I asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. Friends of my dads from Tennessee. They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her \"diet\", and baby food.\n\nWhat I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!\n\nThanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.\n\nTL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing.

Yes, I'm new to the community, no I didn't hear about it through the news reports the other day, but rather heard about it from a family friend.  \n\nIn the past month, my life has essentially fallen apart.  My wife of 15 years has all but thrown in the towel to our marriage.  She has moved back in with her parents, and I'm living in our house with our two children, Jennifer &amp; William.  Along with this added stress, I've just lost my job as a management consultant.  So now I'm left with a broken heart, a hole in my pocket and two hungry kids to feed.\n\nWe're not in as terrible of a position as other members on here, but I was wondering if a kind member would be willing to donate a pizza so I can surprise my kids at some point, and hopefully help them get their minds off our current situation. \n\nThank you all so much for even reading this.","3395":"Some stuff came up and we've been eating ramen noodles so long we've run of of things to put in it to taste better.

Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a \"dick\"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.\n\nBut alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break\/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com\/](www.lctabus.com\/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend\/his mommy: ([Ana](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet!

I just want to go into a small amount of detail in this post and tell you guys how much we're in love. I will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail I'll be going in to.\n\n\nI was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of \"Alright, if you really want to,\" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement \"ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--\"\n\n\nSo we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.\n\n\nSo she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word \"Tony\" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.\nSo I read just the 1 text. It states:\n\"Tony better remember what you asked for last week.\"\nMy stomach got this twisted feeling of \"oh crap how could I forget.\" \n\n\n!!!!! \n\n\nJUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream \"hey wait!\".

I live in Pittsburgh and my boyfriend's visiting for a week.  I haven't seen him since the beginning of May so I'm pretty excited, but here's the situation.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't have a job (I do, but I get paid by the month and my first paycheck isn't coming until June 30th).  The only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  He also sprained his ankle on Saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  Lastly (and I realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to Lake Erie for a day and a half.  \n\n[Following paragraph contains a lot of venting about crazy Polish mothers]\n\nNow you may be wondering \"What's wrong with the last part\" in which I will refer you to the crutches.  Yes, I've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  I've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  The thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  Also, I'm going to have to tell my BF that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, I'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  I know I should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, I can't change my situation RIGHT NOW so I'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.\n\nAnyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say \"I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it.\"  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.\n\nAlso, since I'm getting my first paycheck in June 30th, I'll make sure to donate a pizza.  \n","3654":"I'm not starving or anything, so if someone else posts with a much more dire situation than me, I'd encourage you to send pizza to them.

I am very afraid of you. o Ao\n\nI am a 23 year old from Marietta, GA. I lost my job on my birthday back in May and haven't been able to find anything since. I've been doing art commissions since then to try and boost my morale and keep my chin up, but they've slowed a bit and I just paid a student loan payment. With next to nothing in my fridge, $34 in my bank account and a phone bill coming up, I'm broke and hungry.\n\nI'm also really scared of rejection! o Ao \n\nAlso, if you're interested in anime-style art commissions or anything of the like, please let me know and I'll get you a link to my deviantART page.

Anyone willing to help my boyfriend and I celebrate? As soon as my loan money comes in in January I'd love to return the favor :)","4012":"Hi, I've never requested this before and I feel a bit ashamed in having to do so, but it would make the world of a difference. I have a good, stable job and always have. I've always been responsible with money and have nearly no debt, except for one credit card which I'm about halfway done paying. This last week has wrecked me financially. My car is a piece of shit and I spent $766 on brake stuff (pads, rotors - I can show proof of this) and now I'm nearly broke. \n\nI have about $70 in my account (I can also show proof of this) and I need it to fill my gas tank (which costs about $40 here in Vermont). My dad called me this morning to tell me that my grandmother was rushed to the hospital last night and she has pancreatic cancer. There's nothing they can do. They can't operate. My dad is not doing well. I'm here in Vermont and my family is in Montreal. I'd like to go to Montreal tomorrow to see my grandmother and be with everyone during this time. \n\nMy fridge has hardly anything in it (I can show you this too!) and basically, a pizza would be a life saver tonight. It's been a rough Monday so far. A pizza would mean that I'd have a meal for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow, and dinner on the way to Montreal tomorrow. I can also provide a verification code. I only get paid again on Thursday and so I'm looking to see if anyone will help a girl out. Many thanks.\n","4013":"We dont tend to have fast food pizza, we make all our own food at home, but we do enjoy a good hot pizza every now and then. We are incredibly unlikely to buy OURSELVES a pizza, as we tend to use our food money at the Farmer's Market, but if someone were to buy us a pizza today, I would definitely return the favor, or pay it forward, whichever the sender prefers. We are located in North Florida and we are not at all picky as to which chain the pizza comes from :)","4014":"We ate lunch yesterday around noon, then proceeded to get crazy hammered and have zero food (literally. I checked) in the house. We're also out of money on account of paying for gas to drive some girls home this morning. Fact is, we're starving.

Fair is fair.\n\nCheers!","4015":"I've been having such a down week worrying about my sick mother, being overloaded at work, how we'll be paying rent and upcoming bills, let alone food, for the next week...I would absolutely love some warm food to help tidy my growling stomach and my mind in the meantime.

Thanks regardless!","4017":"I just arrived back at school after visting my family in Wisconsin over the holidays. Unfortunately while I was there I ran in to some pretty serious car problems and a hefty bill.

He is at work and I have the flu and can't get up off the couch and my three children are bugging me about what is for dinner.  Would anyone be kind enough to provide a pizza for us? ","4020":"As the title says, it's been a rough month for my family for a number of reasons financial troubles being on the top of the list. My reason for posting is that groceries have been pretty sparce for the past week or so. The kids, wife and I have been had our fill of bland pastas and such. Payday is in less than a week and the generosity of friends and family in addition to picking up odd jobs here and there are the only things that have gotten us through this month.\n\nLong story short, a pizza sounds unbelievably awesome right about now, even more so when imagine the how excited the kids would be after a week of serving dinner to sad face and disappointed grumbles.","4021":"Just got done paying this months bill, rent, and utilities.

This weekend, we were supposed to go to his family's cabin, and over the course of the week there were many , \"well, I'm going alone!\" and \"I want you to come with, baby\" moments.  That is probably the tamest and most concise way to tell the story.  Last night, he was shining a flashlight repeatedly, directly in my eyes, to try and make me go to bed with him, if that gives any insight.\n\nI am proud of myself for deciding not to go with him this weekend, even if we were on a \"high\" this afternoon. \n\nI am moving out the first of August, and am trying desperately to save money for my security deposit\/first month's rent. To be honest, I was looking forward to free meals with his family, but I decided it wasn't worth it.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that I'm one of those people who doesn't eat when they're stressed out, so right now it's just me, a box of wine, and whatever I ate yesterday hanging out in the house.

After arguing with them over a span of two days and looking at other options, I gave in and am now broke.
